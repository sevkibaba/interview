#### Spark Aggregation Job

##### Single Container Mode
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t neo-spark-job .

# Run with specific batch range
docker run --rm -u root \
  -v $(pwd)/advanced-solution/output:/app/input \
  -v $(pwd)/advanced-solution/output:/app/output \
  neo-spark-job \
  --start_batch 1 --end_batch 20 \
  --input_dir /app/input --output_dir /app/output
```

##### Spark Cluster Mode (Production-like)
```bash
# Start the Spark cluster
docker-compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml up -d

# Submit job to the cluster
./submit_spark_job.sh 1 200

# Monitor the cluster
# - Spark Master Web UI: http://localhost:8080
# - Worker 1 Web UI: http://localhost:8081
# - Worker 2 Web UI: http://localhost:8082

# Stop the cluster when done
docker-compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml down
```

**Cluster Architecture:**
- **1 Spark Master** (port 8080) - Job scheduling and cluster coordination
- **2 Spark Workers** (ports 8081, 8082) - Each with 2 cores and 2GB RAM
- **Job Submission Service** - For submitting Spark jobs to the cluster

**Task Distribution Example:**
- 200 NEOs → 4 partitions → 2 tasks per worker
- Worker 1: Processes partitions 0 and 2
- Worker 2: Processes partitions 1 and 3
- True parallel processing with load balancing

## Testing

### Test Suite Overview
The project includes a test suite located in `data/tests/` that covers both the simple and advanced solutions:

#### Test Types
1. **PyArrow Writer Service Tests** (`test_writer_service.py`)
   - Unit tests for data transformation and parquet file writing
   - Tests with hardcoded sample API responses
   - Verifies correct column mapping, data types, and file structure
   - Uses temporary directories for isolated testing

2. **Spark Aggregation Job Tests** (`test_spark_pipeline.py`)
   - Integration tests for the complete Spark processing pipeline
   - Uses the same Docker image and command pattern as production
   - Tests with sample NEO data from JSON files
   - Verifies aggregation calculations and output structure
   - Compares results against expected values from files

#### Test Data
- **Sample NEO Data** (`sample_neo_data.json`): 3 test NEOs with different close approach scenarios
- **Expected Results** (`expected_aggregation_results.json`): Expected aggregation values for verification
- **Test Data Structure**: Mirrors production directory structure with proper partitioning

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cd data/tests
python3 run_tests.py

# Run individual test suites
python3 -m unittest test_writer_service.py -v
python3 test_spark_pipeline.py
```

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ PyArrow data transformation and parquet writing
- ✅ Spark job execution with Docker
- ✅ Input data validation and processing
- ✅ Output structure verification

- ✅ Yearly breakdown correctness
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

The test suite ensures that both solutions work correctly and can be used as a foundation for additional testing in a production environment.

### Additional Notes

#### Data Storage and Processing Architecture
- **Raw Data Format**: Raw data should be recorded in Avro format for long-term operations since it allows easy schema changes and has higher throughput than Parquet files. This makes debugging easier and enables partial backfills with clever partitioning design.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Recording raw data and API requests in separate modules is better than combining them in a Spark job. Spark machines are expensive for API scraping operations, and the parallel executor architecture lacks the politeness required for API interactions. Moreover, it would be very expensive and complex to handle errors on the fly.
- **Future-Proofing**: Recording raw data separately enables future report requirements to be built on top of the existing data foundation.
- **Rate Limiting**: A more sophisticated rate limiter that considers API limits would be beneficial. Since there are hourly limits on API requests, the API scraper is not designed to scale beyond current capacity.

#### Data Quality and Validation
- **Data Validation**: No data validation for malformed API responses is currently implemented. Since this is mission-critical data, we don't accept errors and need to fix all data before calculating aggregations. This is currently a manual process.
- **Alerting System**: An alerting system and dedicated folder for recording unexpected data after validation would be beneficial. Since incoming data is mission-critical, it needs to be handled properly.

#### Data Processing Design Decisions
- **Unit Consistency**: There is a discrepancy in the case explanation - raw files should have kilometers as the unit for approach distance, but aggregations use astronomical units. We decided to record all `close_approach_data` since it's better to have all raw data available for future report backfills and additional reporting requirements.
- **Data Explosion Strategy**: In the advanced solution, raw files were asked to have all rows exploded from `close_approach_data`. This is not a best practice. We want to separate ingestion and computation pipelines. In a production environment, you would explode data after ingesting raw data using a different pipeline. The ideal design would be: ingest raw data → explode raw data → compute aggregations. For this interview case, we combined exploding and aggregation steps for simplicity. If there were other aggregations to compute, we would separate them into different steps.

#### Missing Capabilities and Future Enhancements
- **Incremental Processing**: No incremental processing capabilities are currently implemented. This can be added with domain knowledge to track the last processed batch and enable resumable operations.
- **Abstraction Layer**: No interfaces or base classes for common functionality are implemented. This was done for simplicity and ease of reading for the interviewer.
- **Error Scenario Testing**: No testing of failure conditions is currently implemented. This can be easily added to the existing test suite in the `tests/` folder.
- **Query Environment**: A Presto (Trino) environment for querying data is not implemented. If reporting requirements change frequently, it would be better to have a Presto-like environment instead of calculating results with Spark jobs. In this case, there should be intermediate stages (Spark jobs) to reduce data size for the query environment.
- **Orchestration**: Job orchestration with tools like Airflow is not implemented in this solution.

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: The solution includes example tests for both simple and advanced approaches. The test suite covers PyArrow writer service functionality and Spark aggregation job processing using the same Docker-based approach as the production pipeline. On top of this structure, other tests would be easily implemented.
